# Hidden Markov Model POS Tagging

This repository contains an implementation of Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The project focuses on training the HMM on a tagged dataset and evaluating its performance on test data.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and preparation
- Training the HMM for POS tagging
- Model evaluation and accuracy assessment
- Visualization of tagged sequences

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Installation

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install nltk pandas numpy

git clone https://github.com/yigitcftcgl/Hidden-Markov-Model-Pos-Tagging.git
